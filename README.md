UselessMine
===========

A BZFlag plug-in that allows players to convert the Useless flag into mines to kill other players simply by typing '/mine' while carrying a Useless flag.

The [original plug-in](http://forums.bzflag.org/viewtopic.php?f=79&t=10340&p=103683) was written by Enigma, then there was a more optimized [rewrite released](http://forums.bzflag.org/viewtopic.php?f=79&t=17630) by sigonasr2, and lastly there is this rewrite. This implementation follows sigonasr2's implementation and is very similar in regards to how it works and the messages that are used during at deaths.

Compiling
---------

### Requirements

- BZFlag 2.4.0+

- [bzToolkit](https://github.com/allejo/bztoolkit/)

### How To Compile

1.  Check out the BZFlag source code.

    `git clone -b 2.4 https://github.com/BZFlag-Dev/bzflag.git`

2.  Go into the newly checked out source code and then the plugins directory.

    `cd bzflag/plugins`

3.  Run a git clone of this repository from within the plugins directory. This should have created a new UselessMine directory within the plugins directory.

    `git clone https://github.com/allejo/UselessMine.git`

4.  Create a plugin using the `addToBuild.sh` script.

    `sh addToBuild.sh UselessMine`

5.  Now you will need to checkout the required submodules so the plugin has the proper dependencies so it can compile properly.

    `cd UselessMine; git submodule update --init`

6.  Instruct the build system to generate a Makefile and then compile and install the plugin.

    `cd ../..; ./autogen.sh; ./configure; make; make install;`
    
### Updating the Plugin

1.  Go into the UselessMine folder located in your plugins folder.

2.  Pull the changes from Git.

    `git pull origin master`

3.  (Optional) If you have made local changes to any of the files from this project, you may receive conflict errors where you may resolve the conflicts yourself or you may simply overwrite your changes with whatever is in the repository, which is recommended. *If you have a conflict every time you update because of your local change, submit a pull request and it will be accepted, provided it's a reasonable change.*

    `git reset --hard origin/master; git pull`

4.  Compile the changes.

    `make; make install;`

### How to Use

To use this plugin after it has been compiled, simply load the plugin via the configuration file.

`-loadplugin /path/to/UselessMine.so,/path/to/UselessMine.deathMessages`

#### Death Messages file

This is an optional file that will store all of the witty death messages announced when a player detonates a mine. If you would like death messages to be announced, you must give the plug-in the file.

In the file, each line is a separate death message. The supported placeholders are the following:

- `%victim%`
    - The player who got killed by the mine
- `%owner%`
    - The player who placed the mine originally
- `%minecount%`
    - The remaining amount of mines left on the field

The order in which you use the placeholders doesn't matter and the placeholders can be used several times in the same death message. Both `%victim%` and `%owner%` are required for each death message; `%minecount%` is optional.


### Custom BZDB Variables

    _mineSafetyTime

_mineSafetyTime

- Default: *5.0*

- Description: The number of seconds a player has to leave the mine detonation radius if they accidentally spawn in it.

### Using Custom BZDB Variables

Because this plugin utilizes custom BZDB variables, using `-set _mineSafetyTime 10` in a configuration file or in an options block will cause an error; instead, `-setforced` must be used to set the value of the custom variable: `-setforced _mineSafetyTime 10`. These variables can be set and changed normally in-game with the `/set` command.

### Custom Slash Commands

    /mine

/mine

- Permission Requirement: Non-observer

- Description: Place a mine
